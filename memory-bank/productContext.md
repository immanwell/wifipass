# 🚀 Product Context

## 1. Why this Project Exists
**The Problem:**
Sharing Wi-Fi passwords with guests is tedious (typing complex strings) and often insecure (shouting passwords across the room).

**The Solution:**
GuestPass allows hosts to generate a physical, scannable card for their network. It is a "set it and forget it" tool for physical spaces.

## 2. User Experience Goals
* **Privacy First:** Users must feel confident that their Wi-Fi passwords are ephemeral and not logged.
* **Instant Utility:** The app must be a single page; no login or signup required.
* **Physical Output:** The print view is the primary deliverable; it must look professional on paper.
